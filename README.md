# DependencyInjectionEx

This is a collection of exercises found on the web.\
Nothing original, just my personal learning of those tutorials with 'minor' changes.

Definition: In the simplest term, dependency injection is passing an object into a class object. \
This allows dependency inversion and is achieved by creating a singleton that manages the life time of the injecting object(s).

Dagger2 is the framework I learned to use. \
It is demonstrated in RunYasso800 project <sup>[1]</sup>.

Hilt is the new Google recommended framework base on Dagger 2.\
Included project is most basic implementation.

Koin is alternative to Dagger that is easier to use.
