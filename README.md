# DependencyInjectionEx

Definition: In the simplest term, dependency injection is passing an object into a class object. \ 
This allows dependency inversion and is achieved by creating a singleton that manages the life time of the injecting object(s).

Dagger2 is the framework I learned to use.  
It is demonstrated in RunYasso800 project <super>[1]</super>.

Hilt is the new Google recommended framework base on Dagger 2. \
Included project is most basic implementation.

Koin is alternative to Dagger that is easier to use.
