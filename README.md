# DependencyInjectionEx

Definition: In the simplest term, dependency injection is passing an object into a class object.  
This allows dependency inversion and is achieved by creating a singleton that manages the life time of the injecting object(s).

Hilt is the recommended dependency inject framework base on Dagger 2.
Begin here with the most basic implementation.
